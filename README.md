# AutoAnalyzer

An intelligent data analysis platform that automatically profiles data and recommends appropriate analysis techniques to extract maximum value.

## Overview

AutoAnalyzer is a scalable application that will:

1. Ingest any data (structured, unstructured, multi-modal)
2. Automatically analyze and profile the data
3. Recommend appropriate analysis techniques based on data characteristics
4. Guide users through the analysis process with clear value propositions

The system is designed to serve users across different skill levels, from business analysts to data scientists, by providing intelligent recommendations tailored to both the data characteristics and business objectives.

## Current Features

- Data ingestion from CSV and JSON files (with stubs for Excel, Parquet, and text)
- Comprehensive data profiling:
  - Basic statistics
  - Column type detection (numeric, categorical, text, datetime, etc.)
  - Missing data analysis
  - Distribution analysis
  - Relationship detection
  - Data quality issue identification
- Analysis recommendations based on data characteristics and user objectives
- Web-based UI for uploading and analyzing data
- Support for different analysis objectives (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive)

## Future Features (Coming Soon)

- Support for unstructured data (text, images, audio)
- Multi-modal data analysis
- Automated machine learning model selection and training
- Interactive visualizations
- Ability to combine multiple datasets for enhanced insights
- Conversation with data via AI assistants
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for analyzing documents like SOPs
- Resource optimization for complex scenarios (e.g., utility field resource deployment)

## Technical Architecture

The AutoAnalyzer platform consists of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer** - Handles data input from various sources and formats
2. **Data Profiler** - Analyzes data characteristics and quality
3. **Analysis Recommender** - Suggests appropriate analysis techniques
4. **Data Understanding Engine** - Extracts insights from data
5. **Value Extraction Pipeline** - Translates insights into business value
6. **Feedback System** - Improves recommendations based on user feedback
