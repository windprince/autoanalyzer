Implementation Roadmap

MVP Phase: Focus on structured data and basic analysis recommendations
Enhancement Phase: Add unstructured data support and more advanced techniques
Intelligence Phase: Implement learning from user feedback
Scale Phase: Optimize for large datasets and complex analyses

Initial Implementation Strategy

Handling a few common data types (CSV, JSON, structured text)
Implementing basic data profiling
Creating a simple analysis recommendation engine
Building a minimal UI

Starting Point: Data Profiler
Automatically understands characteristics of uploaded data (foundational for everything else).

Next Steps

Start by implementing the DataProfiler class and testing it with some sample datasets
Add the AnalysisRecommender with a few basic techniques
Build the simple Flask application to make it interactive
Gradually enhance the profiler and recommender with more advanced features
